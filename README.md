<h4 align="center">Hi! I'm glad you're here. This is "CryptoCurrencyProject", my second bigger project.</h6>
<p>My CryptoCurrencyApp allows users to easily check current prices, changes and updates on crypto currency market. I've created that project, to learn more about Vue and Vuetify. Originally I started that project with friend of mine, which wanted to learn frontend, but at the end, I've created everything by myself.</p> 

<br />

<h3> Things I made in this project: </h3>
  
          - Routing between views using Vue Router
          - Application state management using Vue CompositionAPI
          - Table with all active crypto currencies on market
          - Mobile scaling
          - Functionality to observe currency
          - Login and Regsiter (fully working)
          - API requests
          - Currency details Popup
          - Data loading indicators
          - Dialogs that tells user if action was succesful
              
<h3> Things I want to add: </h3>
          
          - Dashboard info about Trending, Top Gainers and Top Losers currencies
          - Graphs to show currency gains and lose in selected time period
          - Add NFT Tokens info (looking for api)
          - Small blog, where users will be able to read about recent changes on market
          - Settings which will allow user to fully customize app (Change graph colors, select info user wants to see in DataTable and CurrencyDetails )
          - Own API an DB to save user changes, observations etc.
